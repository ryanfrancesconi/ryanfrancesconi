For me, coding ~~is~~ *was* (rip) an art, both a means and an end. Artisanal, small batch, locally sourced, single origin, organic software. 

I started hacking audio C code in 1997, and have weathered many limitations, languages, transitions and deprecations. As we all know -- things have suddenly changed. This is different.

Currently, I'm working independently to create media systems that inspire me to craft, but also interest to me to utilize as a hand tool for music composition. I'm pushing hard to finish the first of these products this spring (2026). Many components will be open sourced here. I don't know how much meaning sharing software has any longer, but community will still matter in our world - no matter how things are assembled from now on.
