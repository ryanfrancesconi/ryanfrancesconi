For me, coding is an art, both a means and an end. Authentic, small batch, artisanal, locally sourced, organic software.

Currently, I'm working independently to create macOS products that interests me to craft, but also interest to me to utilize as a hand tool for music composition.

I'm working hard to finish the first of these products this spring (2026). Many components will be open sourced here.
